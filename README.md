# Designer-For-Hire
This is a website built for a school Digital Technologies Assignment. It is not meant to function as a regular website and I have not included any of my actual details (apart from my name, age, and a bit about my life) because I am not a real Freelance Web Designer, at least not yet ;)

Mr Harding, if you're reading this, I know you said you had no expectations in relation to the README file but I figured I'd have a little fun with it anyway, this has actually been a pretty fun and stress relieving project for me to work on, which is ironic considering it's based on coding which is stereotypically an absolute nightmare
